            <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
            <p>Boulderin is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without
            the use of ropes or harnesses.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems",
              typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of
              moves.
